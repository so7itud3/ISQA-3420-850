## Executive Summary

Our corporation faces the challenge of being able to adapt in an every-changing technological landscape. One major method our development team employs to stay relevant is to leverage open-source software that other development teams have contributed to. Developers retrieve open source codebases and software from repositories such as SourceForge and GitHub. Our corporation has a legal obligation to ensure that the open source software that is being used is used according to the provisions of the licenses for these software packages. Additionally, our corporation must understand and plan for the vulnerabilities in these software package.

We propose to create a system that automates these tasks. Managers will create acceptable use policies for the use of open source software within the corporation. These policies will be stored in a central repository. We will also create a central repository of license and vulnerability information for the software packages chosen by developers. Both managers and developers will be able to search the repository for license and vulnerability information for a given software package and compare it to acceptable use policies.
